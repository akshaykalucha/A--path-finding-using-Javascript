# A--path-finding-using-Javascript

A* Pathfinding Visualization

This is my first attempt at A* pathfinding. I made this visualization to show the beauty of pathfinding. You can modify all major features of my algorithm through the graphics interface. Here I will go through the major features of my program.


go to the JavaScript file and you can customize starting and ending points, inorder to change the obstacle the frequency change the random value of input from anywhere between 0.1(minimum obstacles) to 0.9(maximum bastacle)
